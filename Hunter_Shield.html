            <h1>Hunter and Shield</h1>
            <p>Hunter and Shield is a game, that is played outside with a group of more then 6 people in a swimming pool.</p>
            <p>Unlike other game, I had nothing to do with its creation. I do not know, who invented it, but did not find any description of it on the internet</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This game does not really have winners or losers, it is just a protocol for splashing around. But it is an interesting protocol at that!</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p> All players start in a circle. Each one, randomly selects one other player to be their hunter, and one to be their shield.</p>
            <p> As soon as the game begins, you move in such a way, so that your shield is between you and your hunter.</p>
            <p> Since you also might be the hunter/shield of someone, and everyone tries to achieve their goal at the same time, chaos ensues.</p>
            <p> Depending on your preferences, shoving other players around, or even pinning them in place might be allowed.</p>
            <p> The game ends, when either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>None wants to move</li>
                <li>The whole group goes through the same series of motion</li>
                <li>Everyone is exhausted</li>
                <li>It gets dark</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The game is played in rounds, and the roles of hunter and shield are randomly reassigned after each round.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Here is a simulation, to play around with!</p>
